# gramme.rs

A set of Rust crates to interact with Telegram's API, hence the name *(tele)gramme.rs*.

## Current status

It works! The high-level interface is slowly taking shape, and it can already be used to [build
real projects], such as [RSS bots].

For an up-to-date taste on how the library looks like, refer to the [client examples] folder.

For more documentation, please refer to <https://docs.rs/grammers-client/>.

## Crates

The following crates can be used to work with Telegram in some way:

* **[grammers-client]**: high-level API.
* **[grammers-crypto]**: cryptography-related methods.
* **[grammers-mtproto]**: implementation of the [Mobile Transport Protocol].
* **[grammers-mtsender]**: network connection to Telegram.
* **[grammers-session]**: session storages for the client.
* **[grammers-tl-gen]**: Rust code generator from TL definitions.
* **[grammers-tl-parser]**: a [Type Language] parser.
* **[grammers-tl-types]**: generated Rust types for a certain layer.

## Security

It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev] to verify the trustworthiness of each of your
dependencies, including this one.

As far as I know, this code has not been audited, so if, for any reason, you're using this crate
where security is critical, I strongly encourage you to review at least `grammers-crypto` and the
authentication part of `grammers-mtproto`. I am not a security expert, although I trust my code
enough to use it myself.

If you know about some published audit for this crate, please let me know, so that I can link it
here and review the issues found.

## License

All the libraries and binaries contained in this repository are licensed under either of

* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE] or

at your option.

## Contribution

Thank you for considering to contribute! I'll try my best to provide quick, constructive feedback
on your issues or pull requests. Please do call me out if you think my behaviour is not acceptable
at any time. I will try to keep the discussion as technical as possible. Similarly, I will not
tolerate poor behaviour from your side towards other people (including myself).

It is recommended to run these commands to make the Git experience a bit nicer:

```sh
git config --local blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
cp pre-commit .git/hooks/
```

If you don't have the time to [contribute code], you may contribute by [reporting issues] or
feature ideas. Please note that every feature added will increase maintenance burden on my part,
so be mindful when suggesting things. It may be possible that your idea could exist as its own
crate, offered as [extensions to grammers].

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be
dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.
