# gramme.rs

A set of Rust libraries to interact with Telegram's API,
hence the name *(tele)gramme.rs*.

## Current status

It works! You can access Telegram's API and handle updates, but the internals are a bit rough
and need a lot of work. We're still looking for a nice solid interface on all the public methods.

For an up-to-date taste on how the library looks like, refer to the [client examples] folder.

For more documentation, please refer to <https://docs.rs/grammers-client/>.

## Libraries

The following libraries can be used to work with Telegram in some way:

* **[grammers-client]**: high-level API.
* **[grammers-crypto]**: cryptography-related methods.
* **[grammers-mtproto]**: implementation of the [Mobile Transport Protocol].
* **[grammers-mtsender]**: network connection to Telegram.
* **[grammers-session]**: session storages for the client.
* **[grammers-tl-gen]**: Rust code generator from TL definitions.
* **[grammers-tl-parser]**: a [Type Language] parser.
* **[grammers-tl-types]**: generated Rust types for a certain layer.
