//! This library is a high-level implementation to access [Telegram's API], which essentially
//! lets you automate everything you can do with official Telegram clients and more from Rust,
//! or even control bot accounts, making it a viable alternative to using the [Telegram Bot API].
//!
//! In order to create an application with the library for people to use, you will need to
//! [obtain a developer API ID] first. You can embed it as a constant in your binary and ship
//! that to users (anyone can login, including yourself and bots, with the developer API ID;
//! they do *not* need to provide their own API ID).
//!
//! Once that's ready, connect a new [`Client`] and start making API calls. You may also want to
//! import some [extension traits] to make the experience less bitter.
